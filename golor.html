                because something comes up, drop a message in clan chat and someone should read it before it drops off
                the bottom. This gives the clan a chance to re-organize and reallocate any bases that you may have
                claimed

        <div class="panel-body">Use ClashCaller.com and read our War Rules page.<br/>
            Clashcaller.com is a third-party website that we use to manage our attacks. Every member is entitled to 1
            call, that is to reserve a base that they would like to hit (3 stars!) and is expected to execute an attack
            within the first 12 hours! After that 12 hour period, clashcaller no longer applies. Ask our elders/staff
            for target. DO NOT attack on your own without confirming your target with one of our elders/staff.<br/>
            It's very simple, just click "Join War" and enter the Unique Code that will be provided by our staff at the
            beginning of Preparation Day. Always check Clan Mail on Preparation Day. Once you get the code, go to
            clashcaller.com and enter the code. You will be redirected to a new page. Add your name to the # that you
            wish to attack. For example: You decided to 3-star enemy's #10, add your name next to #10 in clashcaller so
            everyone knows that you are going to hit that base.

            <li class="list-group-item">Try and make your CC hard to get to and as centered as possible in your base. It
                can make any attack a lot trickier for the opponent. As an example, in the last war the one attack on my
                base had the attacker waste 1:30s (half the attack time) trying to get rid of my CC troops. In the end
                she sent in a dragon which was destroyed, after which only then did she start her main attack.
                Unsurprisingly she only managed a 1-star attack and ran out of time, nowhere near getting the TH
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">As for donations for defense. Its best left to the players with higher level
                troops. At the moment, Jeveland organizes this with the other higher players so please refrain from
                doing CC donations voluntarily
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">If you have particular requirements for your clan castle, then let whoever is
                doing the donations know in advance, or leave a message in your war CC request box
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">We don't ever want to see wall-breakers, giants or goblins in the CC. EVER!
                (Unless theres some sort of bizarre special request) Also, all elixir troops should be at least level 4
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Always check your clan castle before war starts and if you find troops that you
                don't like, get replacement troops trained from another clan member before you dump whats already there.
                Better to have a full CC of underpowered troops than one with empty space because you didn't get troops
                in time!

        <ul class="list-group">

            <li class="list-group-item">The aim is for as many of the lower players to get their CLAIMED attacks done
                within the first 12 hours of the war day. This way the lower bases can be cleaned up as soon as possible
                if any stars are missed
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Always try to go into your attack with something in your CC. If you need
                something specific, request it in clan chat and someone should respond to let you know they are training
                it for you along with how long you will have to wait.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">For players in the bottom 5, it might be cheap but you could request hogs in
                your attack CC. You'd be amazed at how much easier a base becomes to 3-star when the some / all of the
                splash damage defenses are gone ;-)
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">If you need ideas / advice / or constructive criticism for your proposed attack,
                feel free to ask in clan chat and hopefully someone will be there to give you advice
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">When doing cleanup, you should look at the bases you can 3-star and prioritize
                in the following order
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">bases already attacked with only one or zero stars b) bottom bases c) cover for
                someone else's cleanup attack if it fails d) 2 starred bases
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">If we get to the point where in all likelihood, the war is already won (Check
                with
                an elder on how likely the win is). Everyone who has an attack left should try a practice attack against
                an
                appropriate base. We get better with practice so try to take the opportunity to improve whenever we are
                presented with one You get 2 attacks, try and use them both!<br/>
                Note also that loot attacking is no longer allowed
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">We don't currently use scouting attacks. But if you ever wanted to help expose
                the CC and any outside traps / hidden teslas, my advice would be to spread a full army of barbarians, in
                a circle around the base. You'd be surprised by how much damage they could do!
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">If a replay exists for a previous attack on your base, make sure to watch it for
                the information on where the traps are / aren't, whats in the CC etc
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">ALWAYS GET RID OF THEIR CC TROOPS FIRST!, especially if you are planning on
                using giants. If you need help or advice on the easiest ways to lure and destroy them, ask in clan chat
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">ALWAYS GET RID OF THEIR CC TROOPS FIRST! just because it needs repeating</li>
